I am a fourth year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Oregon State University, advised by [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia/). My research focuses on unsupervised learning like generative modeling, representation learning and multi-modal learning. I have experience in the collaborative interaction systems, and solving inverse problems in RGB images, hyperspectral images, radio maps, and communication channels.

Prior to joining OSU, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np). I then worked as a machine learning engineer at [Fusemachines Inc](https://fusemachines.com) for 3 years, contributing to projects in recommendation system, optical character recongnition and speech recognition. I also supervised two machine learning engineers, handled ML engineer hiring responsibilities, and developed content for [fuse.ai](https://fuse.ai).
