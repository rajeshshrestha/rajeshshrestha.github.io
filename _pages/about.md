I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Oregon State University and am advised by [Prof. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia/). My research interest is in unsupervised learning like generative modeling, representation learning and domain adaptation.

Prior to joining OSU, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np) and worked as a machine learning engineer at [Fusemachines Inc](https://fusemachines.com) for 3 years. During this time, I worked in projects involving recommendation system, optical character recongnition and speech recognition. During this time, I supervised two machine learning engineers, and was involved in hiring duties and content development for [fuse.ai](https://fuse.ai).
